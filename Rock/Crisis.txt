Crisis
Bob Marley

They say the sun, shines for all
But in some people world, it never shine at all
They say love is a stream, that will find its course
Some people thinks life is a dream
So they making matters worse

But no matter what the crisis is
Doing it, doing it, doing your thing
Give JAH all the thanks and praises
Giving it, giving it, giving it
Give JAH all the thanks and praises

So much have been said, so little been done
They still killing, killing the people
And they having, having, having lots of fun
Killing the people, having their fun
They just want to be the leader
In the house of the rising sun

But no matter what the crisis is
Do your, live it up, live it up, live it up
Give JAH all the thanks and praises
Live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up
Give JAH all the thanks and praises

They say the sun, shines for all
But in some people's world, it never shines at all
They say love is a stream, that will find its course,
And every river runs to sea
Some people still think life is a dream
So they making matters worse

No matter what the crisis is
Do it, live it up, live it up, live it up
Give JAH all the thanks and praises
Live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up
Give JAH all the thanks and praises
His mercies endureth for ever yeah
Give JAH all the thanks and praises
Oh children, come and give JAH
Give JAH all the thanks and praises
